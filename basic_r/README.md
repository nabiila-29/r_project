# What is R?  
R is basically programming language for statistical computing and graphics.  
  
  
Yess. A language. A language is basically a way to communicate with others. Programming language means a language we use to communicate with computer, and R is one of the language. Just like language in the world, we have English, Chinese, Arabic, and other thousand language. There are so many programming language out there and they have their own specific purpose.

Simply, R has two type of syntax.

2. Package Syntax  
We need to install and call the package first before use the syntax.  
`library(<package_name>)`
